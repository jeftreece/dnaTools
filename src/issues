first:

- better vert/horz sort (not just by # of amts)
- step through real data ... and assess whether vp switch working well.
- work with old *.txt files and report to try and figure out how this sort is
  going with that too

refactor:

- should check the subset code ... shorten?
- consolidate get_vix/get_kix routines
- should check get get_vname_by_vix stuff .. shorten?

need help:

- the results need bed info? where is the bed info?

more refactor:

- rename the tables/columns/db sql things a bit better ... more in sync with the way
  master arch is ... also so uses db.py (not my temporary db1.py)
- what's up with all those saved views? still need those?
- x_mx_idxs necessary?

ideas:

- dtype fields would help w/matrix? (ie - can save it "all" to hf5?)

make list of suggestions to Jef/Iain for master:

- how call config.yaml
- enhancements to db.py

- reference: www.jb.man.ac.uk/~mcdonald/genetics/report.html

done:

[x] matrix vertical sort isn't working, why?
[x] sql stuff is slow (recreating saved matrix info), how to optimize better?
[x] Iain's request -- that it show kit #'s for the col names
